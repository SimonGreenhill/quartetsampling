# Quartet Sampling #

Quartet Sampling is a method to analyze molecular phylogenies by calculating branch support using repeated sampling of quartets.  Quartet Sampling differs from other support methods by combining a set of of tests into a single, efficient framework to address phylogenetic discordance.  QS is particularly useful for very largv and data-sparse aligmments or large phylogenomic datasets.

## Usage ##

See the manual for Quartet Sampling (https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/quartetsampling/blob/master/quartetsampling.pdf).
